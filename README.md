# automated_card_game
Building the card game 'War' in python. Practice in Python development.

### The Purpose:
This project is an exercise in logic flow, function construction, coding with a definitive end-product in mind. I aim to develop a single script that will simulate the 'war' card game between two players using the PyDealer library for card and deck classes. This script uses custom functions for dealing, simulating a war, and once one player has run out of cards, declaring/outputing a winner.
