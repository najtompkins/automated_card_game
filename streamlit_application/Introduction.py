    Designed by Nathan-Andrew Tompkins in late 2023 and deployed early 2024, this application is a labor of love, diligence, and grit. The original purpose of this project was to practice **Python application development**. What started out as a simple exercise in logic and coding has evolved into the very thing you are interacting with right now. Since the beginning of this project I've developed 3 different versions of this game, all running similar-but-distinct logical frameworks to house their code. This web-based version is what will be on display whenenever this project is represented.

        ### **Jupyter Notebook:** 
        The un-refined first version of this project was first uploaded on **March 5th, 2024** and further developed through **April 2nd**, nearly a month later. This is, of course, a Pythonic version, designed to be run inside of a Jupyter Notebook environment. This version utilizes the PyDeck library to create instances of decks, cards, hands, etc. When running the `set_up_game_environment()` function in its cell, followed immediately by the `play_war()` function in its cell, the program will simulate the entire game of war from setup to declaring a winner. During this, the program will build 3 dataframes of exhaustive metrics on each round so that the user can see exactly what happened during the game.
        - While this is absolutely a 'War Simulator' in functionality. This version of the program is, simply put, not designed to be used outside of development. The Jupyter environment was instrumental in the early developement of the logic and execution of the simulation, but while the file can be found [here](https://github.com/najtompkins/automated_card_game/blob/main/ipynb_files/war_v6_data.ipynb), it is not intended for general use as it is simply a peek at development in this project's early stages.

        ### **Excel 365/VBA:** 
        This second version was oddly enough, re-built entirely from the ground up using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) inside of Microsoft Excel 365. This is a fully-working version of the game and presents the user with a visual dashboard at the end to see the exhaustive statistics gathered during the game's simulation. Why do I also have a version of this program written in a completely different coding language, running in a program designed for a thousand other uses than playing a card game? Because Excel is ubiquitous in the Data Analytics and Business Intelligence industry (especially for smaller businesses) and I used this same project to further refine my Excel skills by building it out in a different and unique way. Download the workbook [here](https://github.com/najtompkins/automated_card_game/blob/main/excel_files/WarCardGame.xlsm).
        - ***Note: This version is a proof of concept, first and foremost. It does not have the same functionality as the web application, nor is it able to run on MacOS systems. It requires the workbook to be trusted by the user (more information in the project README) and for macros to be enabled within the workbook itself before it is able to run. I am proud of this version, but it is certainly not intended for general use and is, again a proof-of-concept.***

    #### The Goal
    - The goal is to be the first player to win all 52 cards

    #### The Deal
    - The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

    #### The Play
    - Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.
    - If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (10 cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all cards, and so on.

    #### How to Keep Score
    The game ends when one player has won all the cards.
