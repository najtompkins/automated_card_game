# Automated Card Game [Play Now!](https://nathansautomatedcardgame.streamlit.app)

Explore the classic card game 'War' reimagined in Python and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), featuring implementations both as a Streamlit web app and an Excel-based version!

## Overview

Originally designed as a personal coding challenge, this project evolved into a robust application developed in both Python and VBA. The goal was to create a versatile simulation of the 'War' card game that could run on different platforms using the PyDealer library for efficient card management where Python is used, and custom card handling where VBA is utilized. Enjoy the journey from a simple console application to a fully-interactive web-based game, as well as a unique Excel adaptation!

### Project Versions

1. **Python Implementation**: Explore the Jupyter Notebook version of 'War' - [View Notebook](./ipynb%20files/war_v6.ipynb). This version uses custom functions for dealing cards, handling comparisons, wars, data generation/reporting and declaring a winner after any number of game rounds.
2. **Excel VBA Version**: Dive into the Excel adaptation of 'War' where game logic and visual feedback are merged - [Explore Excel Version](./excel_files/WarCardGame.xlsm). This version highlights the adaptability of VBA in creating interactive, data-rich user experiences, animations, and dashboards.
3. **Streamlit Web App**: Experience the game in a modern web application format, accessible from any device - [Play Now](https://nathansautomatedcardgame.streamlit.app). This version is a testament to the flexibility and power of converting a traditional Python application into an engaging web experience.

### Development Journey
*Please note that while the three versions of this application are available to you, these are minimally viable products, meaning that they are functional but not perfect. As I continue development, these programs will be refined and more stable. Thank you for playing my game!*
